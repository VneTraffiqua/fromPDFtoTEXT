# Payment autocomplete

## Description

The script takes the payment data from the PDF document and creates an instance of the class from them.

## How to install?

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for isolate the project

## Launch.

Run `main.py`.
```commandline
python3 main.py
```
